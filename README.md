# Text-Summarizer-project
 A real-time text summarization API powered by transformer models (Pegasus, T5) and deployed using FastAPI.

 This project utilizes Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch to generate concise summaries from text input. It is optimized for real-time processing with FastAPI, making it efficient for integration into various applications.

## Features

 - State-of-the-Art Models – Utilizes Pegasus, T5 for high-quality summaries.
 - Fine-Tuned Performance – Trained on Samsum dataset for improved accuracy.
 - FastAPI Integration – Provides a lightweight and high-performance REST API.
 - Real-Time Processing – Generates summaries instantly via API requests.
 - Evaluation Metrics – Uses ROUGE scores for model evaluation.
