# Text-Summarizer-project
A real-time text summarization project that efficiently extracts key information from lengthy text inputs. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate concise and meaningful summaries.

## Features

✔️ Automatic Summarization: Extracts essential information from text.
✔️ Customizable Parameters: Adjust summary length and style.
✔️ Real-Time Processing: Generates summaries instantly.
✔️ Scalable and Modular: Designed for integration into various applications.

## Tech Stack
NLP Models: Transformers, SpaCy, NLTK
Deep Learning Frameworks: Hugging Face, PyTorch
Processing Tools: OpenAI GPT, T5, BART
Web Integration: Flask, FastAPI (for deployment)

## Project Workflow

Update config.yaml – Configure model and pipeline parameters.
Update params.yaml – Define hyperparameters for the summarization process.
Update Entity Module – Manage text processing entities.
Update Configuration Manager (src/config) – Handle configurations dynamically.
Update Components – Enhance preprocessing, tokenization, and model inference.
Update Pipeline – Optimize text summarization workflow.
Update main.py – Implement the summarization logic and API handling.
Update app.py – Deploy as a web application for real-time usage.
